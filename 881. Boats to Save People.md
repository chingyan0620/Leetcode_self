# 881. Boats to Save People


### <div style="color:orange ;text-align: right">Medium</div>

You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.



* Example 1:

        Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
        Output: 1
        Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)  
* Example 2:

        Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
        Output: 3
        Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)

* Example 3:
        Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
        Output: 4
        Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)

Constraints:

* 1 <= people.length <= 5 * $10^4$
* 1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * $10^4$

## Result
#### 說明:
題目說明需要把人都救回來，每次最多只能就兩個人，並且不能超重  
將所有人由輕到重排序，使用頭尾兩個重量相加，若不超過限制就救回並計算一趟，若超過則選擇載重的回去，直到都載完為止。


```c
int cmpfunc (const void * a, const void * b)
{
   return ( *(int*)a - *(int*)b );
}

int numRescueBoats(int* people, int peopleSize, int limit){
  qsort(people, peopleSize, sizeof(int), cmpfunc);
  int l = 0;
  int r = peopleSize -1 ;
  int count = 0;

  while(l <= r){
    if((people[r] + people[l])<= limit){
      l = l + 1;
      r = r - 1;
      count ++;
    }else{
      r = r -1 ;
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```
