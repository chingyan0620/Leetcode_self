# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
### <div style="color:green ;text-align: right">Easy</div>


You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the $i^{th}$ day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

* Example 1:

        Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
        Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
* Example 2:

        Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

* 1 <= prices.length <= $10^5$
* 0 <= prices[i] <= $10^4$

#### 說明:
題目說明買賣一次找賺最多的，跑過一次的同時記下最低的價位，並計算賺了多少錢，全部跑完就好！！

```c
int maxProfit(int* prices, int pricesSize){
    int min = prices[0];
    int get = 0;
    for(int i = 1 ; i < pricesSize ; i++){
        if(min > prices[i]){
            min = prices[i];
        }else{
            if(prices[i] - min > get){
                get = prices[i] - min;
            }
        }
    }    
    return get;
}
```
