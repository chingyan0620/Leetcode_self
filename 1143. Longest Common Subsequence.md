# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

### <div style="color:orange ;text-align: right">Medium</div>

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

    For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.



* Example 1:

        Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
        Output: 3  
        Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.   
* Example 2:

        Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

* Example 3:
        Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
        Output: 0
        Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

Constraints:

* 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
* text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

#### 說明:
這題參考網路上的解法，據說是DP的經典問題。
使用二維陣列儲存DP結果(需附圖解釋)



```c
#define max(a , b) ((a)>(b)?(a):(b))

int longestCommonSubsequence(char* text1, char* text2) {
    int len1 = strlen(text1) + 1;
    int len2 = strlen(text2) + 1;
    int res = 0;
    int **dp = malloc(sizeof(int*) * len1);
    for(int i = 0 ; i < len1 ; i++){
        dp[i] = calloc(len2 , sizeof(int));
    }
    for(int i = 1 ; i < len1; i++){
        for(int j = 1 ; j < len2 ; j++){
            if(text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]){
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
            }else{
                dp[i][j] = max( dp[i-1][j] ,dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
    }
    res  = dp[len1-1][len2-1];
    for(int i = 0 ; i < len1 ; i++){
        free(dp[i]);
    }
    free(dp);
    return res;
}
