# 2644. Find the Maximum Divisibility Score
 
### <div style="color:green ;text-align: right">Easy</div>


You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums and divisors.

The divisibility score of divisors[i] is the number of indices j such that nums[j] is divisible by divisors[i].

Return the integer divisors[i] with the maximum divisibility score. If there is more than one integer with the maximum score, return the minimum of them.


* Example 1:

        Input: nums = [4,7,9,3,9], divisors = [5,2,3]
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:
        The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 5.
        The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 1 since nums[0] is divisible by 2.
        The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 3 since nums[2], nums[3], and nums[4] are divisible by 3.
        Since divisors[2] has the maximum divisibility score, we return it.
* Example 2:

        Input: nums = [20,14,21,10], divisors = [5,7,5]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:
        The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 2 since nums[0] and nums[3] are divisible by 5.
        The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 2 since nums[1] and nums[2] are divisible by 7.
        The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 2 since nums[0] and nums[3] are divisible by 5.
        Since divisors[0], divisors[1], and divisors[2] all have the maximum divisibility score, we return the minimum of them (i.e., divisors[2]).

* Example 3:

        Input: nums = [12], divisors = [10,16]
        Output: 10
        Explanation: The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:
        The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 10.
        The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 16.
        Since divisors[0] and divisors[1] both have the maximum divisibility score, we return the minimum of them (i.e., divisors[0]).

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length, divisors.length <= 1000
* 1 <= nums[i], divisors[i] <= $10^9$

## Result
#### 說明:
對每一個nums進行餘數運算，檢查是否被整除了，並統計被整除的數量。
取得數量後須進行檢查，第一次比較是否為含有最多被整除的數，若是有則更新最多
被整除的計數，若是與先前統計數量相等則檢查除數大小，更新較小的除數作為回傳結果。

```c
int maxDivScore(int* nums, int numsSize, int* divisors, int divisorsSize){
    int div = 0;
    int res = divisors[0];
    // int *tmp = calloc(divisorsSize , sizeof(int));
    int tmp = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for(int i  = 0 ; i < divisorsSize; i++){
        count = 0;
        for(int j = 0 ; j < numsSize ; j++){
            if(nums[j] % divisors[i] == 0){
                count++;
            }
        }
        if(count > tmp){
            tmp = count;
            res = divisors[i];
        }else if(count == tmp){
            if(res > divisors[i]){
                res = divisors[i];
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}
